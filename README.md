# Working-with-Flask
This repository showcases my work in Flask. This represents my initial steps towards deployment of Machine learning model.

This repository will be completed over time as I excel in this path of learning Flask and applying it to deploy my ML models.

Flask is a lightweight and flexible web framework for Python, created by Armin Ronacher in 2010. It is known for its simplicity, ease of use, and minimalism, making it a popular choice for developing web applications and APIs. Flask follows the WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface) standard.

**Key Features of Flask:**
Lightweight: Flask is a microframework, meaning it has a small core and provides essential tools without imposing a specific directory structure or requiring complex setup.

Modular and Extensible: Flask can be easily extended with various extensions for added functionality, such as form handling, database integration, authentication, and more.

Built-in Development Server: Flask includes a development server with debugging capabilities, which makes it easy to develop and test applications locally.
Jinja2 Templating: Flask uses the Jinja2 templating engine, which allows for dynamic HTML generation with template inheritance and reusable components.
URL Routing: Flask provides a simple and intuitive way to define URL routes and map them to Python functions, enabling clean URL design and easy request handling.

RESTful Request Handling: Flask supports RESTful request handling, making it ideal for building APIs and web services.

**Advantages of Flask:**
Simplicity and Flexibility: Flask's minimalistic approach allows developers to build applications with a clear structure and flexibility to choose their tools and libraries.

Extensive Documentation: Flask has extensive and well-maintained documentation, making it easy for developers to get started and find solutions to common problems.

Active Community: Flask has a large and active community, providing numerous tutorials, extensions, and support resources.

**Use Cases of Flask:**
Web Applications: Flask is ideal for building small to medium-sized web applications with dynamic content.

APIs: Flask is widely used for developing RESTful APIs and web services due to its simplicity and flexibility.

Prototyping: Flask's lightweight nature makes it a great choice for quickly prototyping ideas and testing concepts.

Overall, Flask is a powerful and versatile framework that balances simplicity and flexibility, making it suitable for a wide range of web development projects.
